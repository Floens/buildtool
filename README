buildtool - android build tool for clover

a small python app that listens to webhooks and builds APKs from a repo. the build is done with a docker container.

it is build for clover. the only thing specific to clover right now is the output of the version file.
i might rewrite this later to be more of use to other android projects, or just projects in general.
